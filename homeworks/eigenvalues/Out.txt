A
For part a. I had to program a Jacobi diagonalization method. 
The program is in the file jacobi.cs, and the result of my testing it can be seen below:

Testing jacobi.cyclic ...
Testing V^TAV = D ...
... passed
Testing VDV^T = A...
... passed
Testing V^TV = 1...
... passed
Testing VV^T = 1...
... passed
All tests passed!



In part b, I used my jacobi routine to find permitted energies for the hydrogen atom, by solving an eigen-value problem.

Calculated lowest energy: -0.495096746302708 
(Should be -(E_h)/2 = -0.5 in units of E_h)
I expect f to be given by r*psi100, and can as such write out the expected values of f. These are in the data files 'first eigenvector' and 'second eigenvector', and are plotted in 'Lowest eigenvectors'.
I found these values to be off from their expected values, and realised that it had something to do with the normalisation:
first eigenvector square norm: 1, Second eigenvector square norm: 1
That means the found eigen vectors are normalised, whereas the square norm of the expected values should be <r^2> for the given state. I have used this factor to normalise the expected values.


Varying dr from 0.05 to 0.3 and rmax from 1 to 20, I have collected som data in varying_dr.txt and varying_rmax.txt
