Part a
I have collected tabulated values of sin(x) in a file, and sent these values to my linterp object. I have the collected interpolated values, and integrals.
Since I expect my integral of the sine function to be cos(x)-cos(x[0]), where x[0] is the first number in my array, I have done my calculations on an inteval [-3/4pi, 3/4pi], so my plots are prettier... :)

=================================
Part b
I test my quad spline program, by writing out manually calculated results for each spline, along with my programs result:
For y = x^2, I expect the spline to satisfy s(x)=a(x-xi)^2 + b(x-xi) + c = y(x) = x^2, which is satisfied if a=1, b=2xi and c = xi^2. Lets check the results:
as			bs			cs				
1 (should be 1)		2 (should be 2)		1 (should be 1)
1 (should be 1)		4 (should be 4)		4 (should be 4)
1 (should be 1)		6 (should be 6)		9 (should be 9)
1 (should be 1)		8 (should be 8)		16 (should be 16)

For y=x, one would expect the spline to be s(x)=a(x-xi)^2+b(x-xi)+c = y(x) = x, which is satisfied if a = 0, b = 1 and c = xi.
0 (should be 0)		1 (should be 1)		1 (should be 1)
0 (should be 0)		1 (should be 1)		2 (should be 2)
0 (should be 0)		1 (should be 1)		3 (should be 3)
0 (should be 0)		1 (should be 1)		4 (should be 4)

For y=1, one would expect the spline to be s(x)=a(x-xi)^2+b(x-xi)+c = y(x) = 1, which is satisfied if a = 0, b = 0 and c = 1.
0 (should be 0)		0 (should be 0)		1 (should be 1)
0 (should be 0)		0 (should be 0)		1 (should be 1)
0 (should be 0)		0 (should be 0)		1 (should be 1)
0 (should be 0)		0 (should be 0)		1 (should be 1)

Furthermore, to test my quadratic spline, I have made a plot similar to the one from part a, using the tabulated values of sine
These calculated values are saved in qspline_values_sine.data and plotted in Q_interpolation.svg

=================================
For part C, I had to implement a tridiagonal matrix equation solver.
Testing spline.tridiag ...
... PASSED 

Testing with random 5x5 tridiagonal matrix...
...PASSED 

Next I had to implement a cubic spline, solving the values of b using my tridiagonalised routine.
I compared my cubic spline to the built-in cubic spline from gnuplot, by plotting som random points, and using my routine to connect them. The graoh showing my work is C_interpolation.svg
