Part a
To test my function, I try to solve U'' = -U, by defining vec(y) = (y1, y2) where y1 = U and y2 = y1', so that I can solve y1' = y2 and y2' = -y1, as two coupled ODEs
I calculate a solution to U'' = -U with initial conditions y0 = (0, 1), expecting a sine-function for the answer.

I similarly attempt to calculate U'' = U, with initial conditions y0 = (1, -1), expecting the solution f(x) = exp(-x)

The solutions are plotted in GraphA.svg

I also attempt to recreate the result of the pendulum with friction from the scipy manual
Here vec(y) = (theta, omega), where theta'=omega and omega' = -b*omega - c*sin(theta) with b =0.25 and c = 5.0 in our problem.
The plot is recreated with values determined by my runge-kutta function in Pendulum.svg
I have implemented the changes in my routine, so I can evaluate only the end vector, thus saving time.
I have also changed the step acceptence condition to compare the toleranse and the error componentwise rather than by norm
Now I have come to the part, where I must recreate the plot of the Lotka-Volterra system.
I must solve the system of coupled diff equations:
dx/dt = ax - bxy
dy/dt = dxy - cy
with boundary conditions x(0) = 10, y(0) = 5.
I write the coupled diff eq as a Function, and solve it with my routine. The result is plotted in LotkaVolterra.svg
