The best fit vaues and their uncertainties are is:
a: 4.9511553496486 +- 0.0339477544244211
l: -0.169887082001008 +- 0.00695008119420513
... which yields a half-life of 4.08004641904341 +- 0.166914715082983 -- today we know the value to be 3.5, which does not lie within the estimated uncertainty.
Here, the error in the half life has been determined by error propation: d(1/c) = 1/c^2 dc
