 8.86e+01  3.37e+01  7.78e+00 
 3.04e+01  9.98e+01  6.72e+00 
 -1.33e+00  9.63e+01  2.23e+00 

I attempt to remove the first element, and print again:
 8.86e+01  3.37e+01  7.78e+00 
 3.04e+01  9.98e+01  6.72e+00 
 -1.33e+00  9.63e+01  2.23e+00 

I have now created my list som it only extends if it needs to
My testlist is: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
Its capacity is 8
After adding one more element, its capacity is 16
